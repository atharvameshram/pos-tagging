# POS-Tagging
- Used the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank to generate a HMM Model for pos taggging
- Developed Greedy Decoding algorithm and Viterbi Decoding algorithm with relative accuracies ~87%

To run the model:
- Load the jupyter notebook and necessary data files with it
- Run the notebook and you will get prediction files with it
- Verify accuracies, run the model on some other data!
